1. You are a senior react develpoer creating a quick demo with best practices and modern codebase.

2 - All components should be reusable, meaning, they should not be made limited just for this
implementation

3 - Feel free to use the provided SVG files or your own similar icons

4 - Create the upvote component capable to show two states
A. It has the default (not-selected) and the selected states
a. Default background color #F4F6F8 with arrow #343A40
b. Selected background color #E5E8FD with arrow #253CF2
Note: The blue and red coloured upvotes for the wireframe is there only to
represent the different groups. Use the same state colours for all lists as mentioned
above.

B. Clicking on the component should allow the selection change to be toggled. The handler
for this task should be passed through props.

5 - Create the upvotes list
A. It toggles the current selection state for all the upvote components in the list through the
upvote click
B. The selection from a list should not interfere with the selection from any other lists
C. Allow adding more upvotes to the list by clicking on the add button

6 - Wireframe

A. The + button should add one new upvote to its own list

B. Any newly added upvote should be linked to the same state as the other upvotes in the
list
C. The colour of the upvote is only a visual representation of their shared state. Your final
product should not have multiple colours, only the selected and default states.

7 - Data
A. Use React context, a hook or any way where the data state can be managed for all
upvote lists together
B. Make the data persisted in the browser and allow to show all upvotes with their states
when refreshing the page

8 - Provide one test for selection change based on the click event
